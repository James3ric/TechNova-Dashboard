Employee attrition is a persistent challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment and training costs, disrupted workflows, and decreased team morale. Despite efforts to address turnover, many organizations struggle to identify the underlying causes and predict at-risk employees due to fragmented data and lack of actionable insights.

Without a clear understanding of attrition patterns, HR teams face difficulty implementing effective retention strategies, resulting in avoidable productivity losses and diminished organizational performance. This case study aims to address these issues by developing an HR Attrition Dashboard that consolidates data, highlights trends, and provides actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making and improve workforce retention.

## Key Features

- **Attrition Trends**: Visualize turnover rates and patterns over time.
- **Demographic and Departmental Insights**: Break down attrition by demographics and departments to pinpoint high-risk areas.
- **Reason Analysis**: Highlight key reasons for employee exits to guide targeted retention strategies.
